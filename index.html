  <div class="container">
    <p>This is an application for testing the behavior of JavaScript framework, such as Angular
    Ember, for seriously big tables including thousands of records.</p>
    <p>Firstly, choose a framework for which you would like to run the tests, and then choose a test.
    There are two of them: scroll test and speed test.</p>
    <p><strong>Important!</strong> For the proper results, each run test will be opened in a new tab.
    And, before running the test, please, make sure that tabs from
    previous test are closed. To run several tests in parallel is not recommended due to limitations of
    browsers performance.</p>

    <form class="form-inline">
      <script type="text/x-handlebars">
        <legend>Choose a framework:</legend>
        {{
          view Ember.Select contentBinding="App.frameworks.content"
            optionLabelPath="content.title"
            optionValuePath="content.value"
            selectionBinding="App.frameworks.selected"
        }}
        <legend>Scroll Test</legend>
        <p>This test checks the scrolling behavior of big and dynamic tables.
        The test create a big table (1000 - 4000 rows, based on your selection), and ads a row every second.
        This is a quality test, meaning you will have to play a bit with the scroll to get a feeling of how
        it works on each platform.</p>
        {{
          view Ember.Select contentBinding="App.scrollOptions.content"
            selectionBinding="App.scrollOptions.selected"
        }}
        <button class="btn btn-success" {{action launch "scroll"}}>Launch</button>
        <legend>Speed Test</legend>
        <p>
          This test checks how fast the platform can handle adding rows to a table. This is a little artificial
          test where we do want to check how fast each table handles event addition, so we want to neutralize "batch"
          processing advantages that Ember might have. To achieve this we add one row every 5 mSec using a timer,
          and check the total time that each platform takes to finish.
        </p>
        {{
        view Ember.Select contentBinding="App.speedOptions.content"
          selectionBinding="App.speedOptions.selected"
        }}
        <button class="btn btn-success" {{action launch "speed"}}>Launch</button>
